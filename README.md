# STA2102_BAR
Self-study of a Bayesian approach to time series forecasting by creating a Python class to facilitate a standard workflow.

## Overview
This repository is part of a course project for STA2102 and is aimed at exploring Bayesian Autoregressive (BAR) models. The goal is to design and implement a Python package that provides a consistent and user-friendly workflow for modeling univariate time series using a Bayesian framework.

The project serves as both:
- A self-study in Bayesian time series analysis (using `PyMC`), and
- A toolbox to simplify Autoregressive model building, inference, and prediction using Bayesian methods.

## Reflection + A Note for the Professor

Hi Professor,

I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the course! It challenged my understanding of familiar concepts while introducing me to new ideas, inspiring me to try my hand with `PyMC` for this Course Project. While I'm pretty proud of it as a first-time user of a probabalistic programming language for Bayesian inference, I'm sure there are inefficiencies and missed cases.

All the best,

Alex Faassen
